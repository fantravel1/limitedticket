## 🌍 Overview

**LimitedTicket.com** is not a ticket seller.

It is a **global ticket intelligence + readiness platform** for events that are genuinely hard to access.

If you want the impossible ticket — this is where you start.

LimitedTicket exists to answer:

- Why is this ticket hard?
- When does it actually drop?
- How does the system work?
- What is legit vs a scam?
- How do I maximize my odds *fairly*?

This is not Ticketmaster.
This is **how the ticket game really works — explained clearly.**

- resale hype

But:
- what’s hard

- how to play fairly

Emotional hook:

> **“If you want the impossible ticket, start here.”**
